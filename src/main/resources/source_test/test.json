Many computer users run a modified version of the Google system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of Google which is widely used today is often called Windows, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the Google system, developed by Google. Windows is normally used in combination with the Google operating system: the whole system is basically Google with Windows added, or GOO\/Windows. The so-called Windows distribution is really GOO\/Windows!"

I&#039;m between using Keepass and Pass. (For those who aren&#039;t familiar with it, https:\/\/www.passwordstore.org\/ is the link. It touts itself as a password manager that obeys unix philosophy, although it&#039;s not quite that if you look into it.)  I&#039;m personally torn between the two, since keepass seems to be easier to use cross platform, but I do like the idea of Pass.  So, what password manager do you use? Why? Do you like it?"

I&#039;m going to buy a new notebook, and i&#039;m left wondering: how much of a difference is there between a  6th gen Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 i5-6300HQ (Quad Core, 2.50 GHz expansible up to 3.2 GHz, Cache 6M)  And an 6th gen Intel Core i5-6300HQ (3M Cache,2.3GHz up to 3.2 GHz with Max Turbo) This is all the information the stores offer me, and the rest of the machine setup will be the same. The second optionis way cheaper, and so i&#039;m wondering how much am i to lose if i get it rather than the first one. Thanks!"
